// Sequences: ordered steps, each recalling a snapshot or driving a timeline (and carrying a text for the operator),
// played by GO / GO BACK — the cue list of a show. Several sequences may execute concurrently;
// the selected sequence determines which one GO / STOP edits, not which running cues survive.
// Sequence steps are saved with the project; runtime playhead positions are not. Owned by the Engine (Engine::sequencer()), it goes through the Engine's public API only, and
// shares its lock.
//
// A step waits its pre-wait after its GO, then recalls its snapshot, whose fade is the step's action (its duration:
// the snapshot's longest time) — or acts on its timeline (Play: the time it plays, when it ends, followed as it goes:
// a speed or a loop mode changed meanwhile, by a step or by OSC, is taken into account, and a frozen timeline
// (speed 0) is waited for until it moves on and ends; the other actions take no time). What comes next (as in QLab):
//  - Wait: nothing, the next step waits for GO (button, Space, OSC);
//  - Follow: the next step gets its GO once this one was triggered (pre-wait over), after the post-wait, without
//    waiting for the action to end;
//  - AutoFollow: the next step gets its GO once the action is over, after the post-wait.
// A sequence can follow a clock: a value of the show in seconds (an audio or video layer's Playhead, a Timecode
// generator's Position: internal, LTC, MTC, ATC). A step with a timecode gets its GO when that clock gets there, as a
// tape plays the show (Engine::followSequenceClocks): each step passed on the way, in order; after a jump (a seek, a
// rewind, a loop), only the last step at or before where it landed (it chases). The other steps wait for GO, or follow.
// Tracking (a sequence's mode, on by default): a jump to a step that is not the next one (a step played from the list, OSC,
// GO BACK, the timecode chasing) first plays at once what the steps before it would have left — from the last snapshot
// before it, each preset at its end and each timeline told what to do, in order, as if each had had its GO one after the
// other — then plays the step as usual. A step that starts another sequence is not played again then.
// A snapshot recalled does not stop the ones still running: only the values it holds itself are taken over.
//
// The waits run on a clock thread of their own (the cue clock): a pre-wait or a follow ends on time even while the
// interface is busy (a drag, a project loading, a flood of log lines). A step the clock fires recalls its snapshot
// from there at once; the interface is told afterwards (setRecallRecorder: its undo stack), with the state before.
// A GO from the interface or OSC is played on the Sequencer's own thread, as before (setRecaller).
